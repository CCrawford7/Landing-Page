# Landing-Page
Odin Project landing page example.

This project will involve creating a pre-designed website using javascript and CSS. 

Kevin Powell has appeared in my dreams more than once, and my youtube homepage has been entirely replaced by various CSS and flexbox tutorials.

Landing page consists of content from the animated TV show Cowboy Bebop, all rights to which belong to the respective owners; Shinichiro Watanabe and Studio Sunrise. No copyright infringement is intended and no rights claimed by myself.
